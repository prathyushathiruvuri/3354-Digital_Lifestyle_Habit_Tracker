The system will be developed using an iterative process model. Specifically, we will use the Scrum method to incorporate agile methodologies into the development of the application. This agile process will always be centered on the initial requirements established within this report and the project scope document. However, it is very possible that the wants and needs of potential users will differ from our initial requirements, so an iterative model will give us the flexibility to react to changing user requirements discovered in later iterations.
An iterative process model is ideal for our application because it produces business value earlier in the development lifecycle. Our team can create an application with the essential features and build and improve the application over time. Furthermore, this model allows our team to focus on customer research and testing earlier in the software lifecycle, preventing us from investing in big features, such as exporting data to a variety of formats, when they may provide no value for users at all. Project issues and changes can also be detected earlier. Altogether, an iterative process model provides us with more flexibility in the development of our application that will hopefully avoid major time and money losses in the later stages of implementation.
